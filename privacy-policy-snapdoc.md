Privacy Policy SnapDoc
---------------

This Privacy Policy outlines how SnapDoc collects, uses, and protects your information. By using this app, you agree to the terms of this Privacy Policy.

### Information Collection and Use

Our app allows you to convert images to PDF and Word documents. We do not collect, store, or share any personal information from users, except as described in this policy.

### Data Processing

Images and Documents: Our app processes images and converts them to PDF and Word document formats on your device. All processing occurs locally on your device, and no images or documents are uploaded to our servers or shared with third parties.

Storage Permissions: The app requires access to your deviceâ€™s storage to select images for conversion and to save converted documents. This access is solely for the functionality of the app and is not used for any other purpose.

### Third-Party Services

We may use third-party libraries or SDKs that comply with Play Store policies. However, no personal data is collected, stored, or shared by these services in the context of this app.

### Data Security

We take reasonable measures to protect the data processed within the app. Since all processing occurs locally on your device, data is not transmitted over the internet, which minimizes exposure risks.

### Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update our Privacy Policy periodically. Any changes will be posted here, so please review this policy occasionally.
